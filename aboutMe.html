          I'm Microsoft MVP since 2001 and I have a strong experience in Software development.<br>
          With more than 20 years of experience, my skills are very wide using a lot of technologies.<br>
          I have written about 15 books about Computing and Software development, a lot of articles in computer magazines and I have recorded a lot of videos and courses.<br><br><br>

          <font color="#F5DA81"><strong>Profesional Experience</strong></font><br>
          <font size="2px">
          I have worked in all Software development phases and with different roles.<br><br>
          I have worked as developer, analyst, doing testing tasks (unit tests, functional tests and integration tests), as Software Architect, as Project Manager and in CAU departments giving support to the development department (level 1, 2 and 3).<br><br>
          I have worked developing Software for different customers and as final product. These works have been done in big and small projects.<br><br>
          My best skills are with Microsoft technologies. Microsoft Azure, Microsoft .NET, C#, PowerShell, etc.<br><br>
          I have worked with other technologies too, and If I don't know any technology, I have not problem to learn it. I love my work and the technology and I like to learn new things always.<br><br><br>
